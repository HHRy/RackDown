#RackDown

##Simplistic serving of Markdown files at HTML over Rack

********

This is pretty much what it says on the tin, it's simple and punts markdown files to the browser through 
RDiscount.

It's really all there is to it. It's more of a toy just now than anything all that useful. If you want
something that's production ready, try [mojombo/jekyl][1] which is pretty cool

You're free to do what you want with this as long as it's not for commercial gain. Don't use it in production
it will bite you in the ass.
